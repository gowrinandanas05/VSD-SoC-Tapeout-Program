The video explains the various stages to go from an idea in C language to a real chip used in electronics.

Step 0 (O0 = O1) → Idea to C program
First, the chip’s functions are written in C language 

Step 1 (O1) → C model specs
This is a specification stage where the chip’s behavior is modeled in C.
It’s like a rough draft or simulation that makes us understand the ouput of a chip if we give  a particular input.

Step 2 (O2) → RTL (Verilog model)
Now, the chip design is written in Verilog (hardware language).
This is the soft copy of the hardware—like drawing actual circuit diagrams.
The design has blocks such as:
Processor (the brain),
Peripherals/IPs (extra features, like sensors or timers).

Step 3 (O3) → Integration
All parts (processor + peripherals + memory + analog blocks) are combined into one SoC (System on Chip).
The design is turned into a Gate-Level Netlist (electrical circuit connections).

Step 4 (O4) → Final Chip
The fabricated silicon is used in real devices.
